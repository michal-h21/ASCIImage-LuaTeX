# ASCIImage for LuaTeX

I've by accident found [ASCIImage
project](https://github.com/cparnot/ASCIImage). One can draw simple images
using this technique. More details in this [blog
post](http://cocoamine.net/blog/2015/03/20/replacing-photoshop-with-nsstring/).

I thought it might be funny to port this project to Lua in order to use it with
LuaTeX. So there is that attempt.
